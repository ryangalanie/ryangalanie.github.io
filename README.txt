This is my first attempt at creating a website using HTML and CSS.

I had no previous experience with either of these languages before creating
this website, so I used a template from HTML5up.net

After pulling the template, I altered the code in order to create a representation
of a website that I think characterizes myself the best. I included different icons,
images, and side pages to be used throughout the website on my own.
